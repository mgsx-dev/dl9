Models:

* emissive need add emissive shader to be exported
* lights are not so intense as in Blender
* no metallic baking: needs to fake it using roughness slot (too complicated with complex shaders)

* vertex group without armature cause vertex weight/join export.. (bug GLTF ?)
  solution: disable skinning when exporting
